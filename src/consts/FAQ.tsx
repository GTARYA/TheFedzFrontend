        question: 'Wtf is The Fedz? Another DeFi Ponzi?',
        answer: 'Nah, The Fedz is the opposite of a Ponzi. Itâ€™s a new financial system that lets you mint an under-collateralized stablecoin (FUSD) without overlocking your assets like some yield-farming scam. Itâ€™s built to survive bank runs and market crashes, unlike most DeFi experiments that die in a bear market.',
    },
    {
        question:
            'Wait, under-collateralized stablecoin? Doesnâ€™t that mean itâ€™s gonna implode like UST?',
        answer: 'Good question. No. FUSD isnâ€™t backed by hype and Hopium rather itâ€™s designed with real economic models (think Diamond-Dybvig & Andolfattoâ€™s work) that make sure it stays stable even when everyone panics.Terra-Luna utilized a dual-token system where the value of Terra was maintained through the minting and burning of Luna. This mechanism proved vulnerable to extreme market conditions, leading to significant instability and eventual collapse. The Fedz uses a bank-run mitigation mechanism to manage liquidity, preventing the classic death spiral that wrecked UST.',
    },
    {
        question: 'So how do I mint FUSD? Do I need to deposit a ton of ETH?',
        answer: 'Nope. Unlike traditional stablecoins that need 100%+ collateral, FUSD lets you mint with less. The exact mechanism involves Private Liquidity Pools (PLPs), where NFT holders get priority on liquidity access and yields. The system ensures thereâ€™s always enough backing without forcing you to overcommit your assets.',
